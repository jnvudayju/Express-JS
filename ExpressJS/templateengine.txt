A template engine enables us to use static template files in our application. At runtime template enigine repalces variables in a template file with actual values, and transform the template into an html file sent to the client. This approach makes it easier to design ans HTML page.
Some popular template engines that work with Express are Pug, Mustachea and EJS (Embedded JavaScript Enggines). 
The Express application generator uses Jade as its default, but it aslo supports several other template engines.
Handlebars.js is an extension of Mustache and hbs is a ExpressJS view engine for handlebars.js .
